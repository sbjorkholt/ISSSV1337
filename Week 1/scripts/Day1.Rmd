Hello everyone!

Welcome to Political Data Science Hackathon. We're thrilled to have you here with us, and we look forward to spending a great and interesting summer together.


### What is a hackathon?

Hackathons are a bit like festivals. People come together in an intense and focused setting to have a shared experience. One of the main differences, I would say, is that in a hackathon you also work together in a team to create something. By definition, hackathons are events in which "a large number of people meet to engage in collaborative computer programming." Usually, the end goal is to produce something, like a game, a software, or an API.

Hackathons are great because they allow us to be reminded of a few important facts: (1) Team-work is awesome when it works, (2) We can create great things in short time if we work with focus and (3) One of the best ways to learn is learning by doing.

Oh, and failing is a part of the process.

Naturally, we do not expect you to sit tight six weeks in a row and work with iron focus on your tasks throughout the summer months. However, we hope that you will take some of the ideas behind hackathons to heart. This is a playground just as much as it is a course. Learning, creating and producing is supposed to be challenging, rewarding, frustrating and - especially - fun! We hope this course will allow you to experience just that.


### How does this course work?

This course runs over six weeks. You will produce a report (or an app, if you like), that is related to a problem statement. The problem statements are provided by actors from the work life. You work in teams with people from different disciplinary backgrounds. In the end, you present your final product to the rest of us and the work life actors, and one team wins the hackathon. They receive a price! Otherwise, the course is pass/fail. We expect fun competitiveness and warm cooperativeness.

Please note: **In the third week, we have a long weekend (14.-17. June) and from week 4, we change location from Blindern to Statistics Norway (Akersveien 26).**

Throughout the course, we have three goals in mind:

1.  Introduce and teach some basic data science skills.
2.  Demonstrate how to work effectively in cross-disciplinary teams.
3.  Give an opportunity to learn and produce something worklife related.

This course will not cover everything data science related. In fact, it will only give you a glimpse into the world of data science. However, hopefully it will give you the knowledge you need to pursue more knowledge. You see, data science is a highly cross-disciplinary field, and we need people with different competences. To illustrate, look at the figure below. Many would agree that data science is some sort of cross-over between computer science, statistics and domain expertise. Often, this means building high-end knowledge in one of the circles, and knowing enough about the other circles to be able to work in team-based contexts to draw on each other's specialties. Being able to understand, translate and work cross-disciplinary is an incredibly useful skill.

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE, center=TRUE, fig.cap="The cross-disciplinary nature of data science", out.width = '50%'}

```

So, what do we mean by the different points above? Well, in short:

*1. Introduce and teach some basic data science skills.*

-   Using R (functions, visualization, paths)
-   Collaborating using Github
-   Finding data (working with databases, APIs and webpages)
-   Programming with text
-   Machine learning (supervised and unsupervised)

*2. Demonstrate how to work effectively in cross-disciplinary teams.*

-   Working under agile principles.
-   Using know-how from team-based work.

*3. Give an opportunity to learn and produce something work life related.*

-   Work on a problem statement provided by work life organizations.
-   Get some examples on how data science can be used in work-life contexts.
