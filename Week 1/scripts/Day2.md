# Plan for today

## What we will learn today:

 - What R and RStudio is.
 - Writing and running code.
 - Calling functions.
 - Introduction to Rmarkdown and Jupyter Notebooks.
 - Paths and directories.
 - Github
 
## What we will do today:
 - Download R and RStudio (if you haven't already).
 - Set up a shared repository in Github.
 - Work with version control in Github.


# What is R and RStudio?

R is a programming language, along with many other programming languages. Perhaps you've heard of some of them? Python, Java, Javascript, PHP, C, C++... We use these programming languages to communicate with the computer. Typically, there are lots of trade-offs with using one language over another, for example whether you want your code to be easily readable by a human, or whether it should make the requests run fast. Also, some programming languages are good for web development (e.g. Javascript and PHP), some work great for background processes (e.g. C and C++), and some are favorites for mathematics and statistical computing (e.g. python and R). We will be focusing on R in these sessions, though we have a long-term hope of integrating some python as well.

We often say that we "code in R", but we "work in RStudio". The reason for this is that R is the machine doing the calculations, while RStudio is the framework we work within. If this was a car, then R would be the engine and RStudio would be the bodywork.


## Installing R and RStudio (adapted from Louisa Boulaziz)

### R

1. Open an internet browser and go to www.r-project.org
2. Click the "download R" link in the middle of the page under "Getting Started".
3. Select a CRAN location (a mirror site) and click the corresponding link. Here you should go to the Norway click on the link.
4. Click the "Download R for Windows" or the version for your computer. Link at the top of the page. If you have an old Mac, you need to read the next page carefully.
5. Click on the "install R for the first time" link at the top of the page (Windows). Mac users have to choose the version of R that is suitable for their software system. Old Macbook-users need to make sure that they click on the link corresponding to their software. If you are unsure about your software, click the apple in the left hand corner and go to "about this Mac". There it will say MacOS followed by the name of the software.
6. Click "Download R for Windows" and save the executable file somewhere on your computer. Run the .exe file and follow the installation instructions. 
7. Now that R is installed, you need to download and install RStudio.

### RStudio

1. Go to www.rstudio.com and click on the "Download RStudio" button.
2. Click on the "Download RStudio Desktop".
3. Click on the version recommended for your system, or the latest Windows version, and save the executable file. Run the .exe file and follow the installation instructions.
