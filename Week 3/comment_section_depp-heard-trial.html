The look on her face as the verdict was being read is, sadly, the most authentically upset face she had  had during the trial. I keep hearing by some that this verdict is horrible for real victims of domestic violence, and she also said it in her statement afterwards.  The fact that she keeps saying that is the true problem for real victims.  And she is such a narcissist she can‚Äôt stop saying it.

The judge was so polite, professional, poised and patient while being firm at the same time. She really did set an example for so many other judges.

This is a big win because it shows we can‚Äôt automatically believe all accusations. We must remember INNOCENT UNTIL PROVEN GUILTY.

Proud of our jury system. They did the job that was entrusted to them and did it responsibly and with great thought.   There are too many people that are twisting the legal system for their own purposes and too many frivolous lawsuits.  Glad for Depp. He deserves a bit of happiness now.

She‚Äôs an embarrassment to DV abuse victims. Her statement truly had me disgusted. I don‚Äôt understand why she‚Äôs even getting money from this? She deserves nothing!!!

Imagine being someone in this situation who was actually telling the truth, sitting there blank face.  Listening to your peers Basically calling you a liar. You would be in a puddle of your own tears just mortified 
Amber.. she got nothing.

This was an intense journey for everyone involved. I want to shout out a very loud CONGRATULATIONS for these incredible people. For Johnny's amazing, badass legal team and for the perfect job they've done. For the judge, for all of her patience and profesionalism. For the entire jury and their attention to details. For Johnny himself, for having the courage to expose so much of his private life and for being the beautiful, talented and kind hearted man that he is. I am SO HAPPY for him. He showed the truth to the world, cleared his name and he's finally free from such a heavy burden that he was carrying, free to move on and SHINE. ‚ú® 
Congratulations to everyone! 
Faith in #humanity and the #law restored. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏èüôèüôèüôè

As a man who was scared into taking a plea deal to domestic battery. With no resources to properly defend myself, or knowledge of the legal system, as I had never been in trouble before. I find this especially gratifying. I was beaten and belittled by a woman for years. I lost my sense of self. I was isolated from my friends, and when my face was bloody, and the cops were called I was taken to jail because she had bruises on her forearms from me trying to stop her physical abuse. Men were given the golden ticket for far too long, and I am against all form of violence towards women. However, we should still have a voice too. Good on our justice system and the jury for listening to the facts and exposing the truth.

She dared him. On audio. She recorded. Tell the world your a victim. He did. A jury of his peers heard this. 
She said. I hit you. I didn‚Äôt punch you. We heard her. She bullied. Goaded. I‚Äôm a DV survivor. Not victim. Survivor. I recognized her bullying and goading. I remember the violence, all the details of what happened to me. We all do. 
I need her to get up and go to work tomorrow. Raise her kid. Go to a second job. Just like we did and do. She‚Äôs no spokesperson. Not for us. She‚Äôs an inaccurate historian. He proved his case.

Make no mistake about it. It IS a slamdunk victory for JD. The most important issues in this trial is whether it is true that JD is an abuser & whether AH can prove that her claims isn't a hoax. Who cares whether the Waldman's statement about the apartment being messed up under the direction of AH's lawyer & publicist is defamatory or not??

Wow. The look on her face when she heard the verdict was the only time that her face actually looked truly upset. Just more proof that she was lying through out this whole trial. I truly believe that she thought she was going to win. Crazy. I‚Äôm glad Johnny got the justice he deserved.

When they called Amber's bs story a "transformative moment for women victims of domestic violence" they weren't wrong. Now many more victims are going to have their stories called into question or flat out ignored unfairly because of what Amber did and struggle even more over the decision to come forward or not.

She could have just taken seven million dollars (tax free) for a fifteen month marriage and moved on; but she chose to be cruel and deceitful instead. Now, she owes him more than he paid her.
