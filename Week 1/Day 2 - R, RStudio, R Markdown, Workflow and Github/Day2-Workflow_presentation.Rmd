## Questions{.build}

Where do you plan to communicate?

 - Teams?
 - Canvas?
 - Messenger?
 - Slack?
 - Discord?

How many have installed R and RStudio already?

## Why use R?

-   R is free

## R and RStudio

 - R is the engine
 - RStudio is the car

<br>
<br>

```{r, echo = FALSE}
library(cowplot)
ggdraw() + 
  draw_image("../../figures/car-engine.jpg", width = 0.5, height = 1.3) + 
  draw_image("../../figures/car.jpg", width = 0.5, height = 1.2, x = 0.5)
```

## Github

**Why?**

 - It makes collaboration easier.
 - It gives your work exposure and publicity.
 - It can be an important component in integration with other platforms.

**R**: www.r-project.org

**RStudio**: www.rstudio.com

## How RStudio works

```{r, out.width="100%", fig.align="center", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("../../figures/RStudio_overview.png")
```

## Creating scripts

```{r, eval = FALSE}

1+1

print("Hello world!")

vector <- c(2, 5, 10, 3)

mean(vector)

paste("Hello", "World", "!")

# This is a comment.

```

## RStudio with Github

1. Find the Tools menu in the top of the RStudio interface and go to Global Options.
2. Click Git/SVN.

## Git operations

 - git pull
 - git add
 - git commit
 - git push

## Paths and folders

```{r, out.width="100%", fig.align="center", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("../../figures/rfolders.png")
```

## What is R Markdown?

 - YAML header
 - Headers
 - Text (+ bold, italics, code)
 - Coding chunks
 - Settings for coding chunks
 
eval = FALSE

## Objects in R   

 - Assigning values to objects
 
 - Different data types

| Data type   |                        Properties                        |
|-------------|:--------------------------------------------------------:|
| `numeric`   | contains decimal and whole numbers, also called "double" |
| `integer`   |               contains only whole numbers                |
| `character` |           contains character strings ("words")           |
| `factor`    |     contains categories (either ranked or unranked)      |
| `logical`   |         contains only two values, TRUE and FALSE         |
