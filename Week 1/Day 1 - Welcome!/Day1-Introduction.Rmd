```


## What is "political data science"?

**Political science**: Domain knowledge about power relations, institutions and broad analytical skills for studying social phenomena.

```

## Course material

 - [Main course material](https://pages.github.uio.no/solvebjo/Political_Data_Science_Hackathon_2022/index.html)
 - R for Data Science
 - Storytelling with data
 - Text mining with R
 - Machine Learning for Social Scientists
 
But consider these *learning resources* rather than syllabus. The goal here is to learn through creating, so use these resources to look up things you wonder about rather than read them from A to Z.

## Course overview

 - Week 1: Team work, Github, R, RStudio and R Markdown. Presentations from stakeholders.
 - Week 2: Data gathering and visualization.
 - Week 3: Text analysis.
 
 - Week 4: Machine learning.
 - Week 5: Machine learning, iterative work, deployment and IT communication.
 
 - Week 6: Finishing projects and final presentations.


## The "final exam"

1. An R Markdown report exploring the case (optionally including a dashboard)
2. A Github repository with reproducible code
3. A team presentation at the **4th of August** for the stakeholders and others

```{r, out.width="30%", fig.align="center", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("../../figures/exam-hat.png")
```
<br>

 - The course ends with a pass/fail grade.
 - And a reward for the winner team.
 

## The **one-up awards**

 - We are a very diverse group in terms of backgrounds, programming competencies and so forth
 - To capitalize on that, we need to help each other out
 
The **one-up awards**: Two awards to the two students who make a particular effort to help others out.

## Cases and stakeholders{.smaller}

Case descriptions can be found in [Canvas](https://uio.instructure.com/courses/39604/modules).

 - **SSB**: How can we contribute to better official statistics using webscraping to create an indicator of statistical quality from the "About the statistics" part on www.ssb.no?
 
 - **NORAD**: How can we use classification algorithms to discover whether an aid agreement also contributes to reduction of greenhouse gas emissions?

 - **UNA (FN-sambandet)**: How can we use the *storingscrape* API to explore the political effect of UNA?

 - **OAG (Riksrevisjonen)**: How can we use various data sources on health statistics to map the efficiency and quality of the Norwegian health care system?

 - **OPX**: How can we use various data sources on NGOs to create a product that maps the most efficient and robust NGOs for investors?

## Agile working methods

The *agile manifesto*:

 - Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
 - Working software over comprehensive documentation
 - Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
 - Responding to change over following a plan

```{r, out.width="40%", fig.align="center", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("../../figures/build-measure-learn.png")
```

## Agile working methods

 - **Minimum viable product** (MVP): The least finished product you can make that will still allow you to test the functionality.

 - **Sprints**: Short sessions of work (e.g. one week) with clearly defined tasks
  
 - **Stakeholders**: Frequently talk to the people who are going to use your product -- does it address their needs?
 
 - **Roles**:
    - Product owner: Knows what the product should look like in the end
    - Team: Developers of the product
    - Scrum master: Facilitates the work
